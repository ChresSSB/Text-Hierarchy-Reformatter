Examples and Definitions of Abnormal Behavior 


CHAPTER OUTLINE 


I. 
An overview of abnormal psychology 
A. 
Psychopathology (pathology of the mind): the symptoms and signs of mental disorders 
including such phenomena as depressed mood, panic attacks, and bizarre beliefs 
B. 
Abnormal psychology is defined as the application of psychological science to the study of 
mental disorders 
C. 
Mental disorders are defined by a set of features (symptoms) 
D. 
Terms: psychosis, delusion, insanity, nervous breakdown, syndrome 
II. Defining abnormal behavior 
A. 
Personal distress—subjective experience of suffering; misses cases in which individual does 
not identify own thoughts/behaviors as problematic 
B. 
Statistical norms—how common or rare it is in the general population 
1. 
By definition people with usually high levels of anxiety or depression would be 
considered to be abnormal because their experience deviates from the expected norms 
2. 
Another weakness of the statistical approach is that it does not distinguish between 
deviations that are harmful and those that are not 
C. 
Maladaptiveness—Wakefield’s harmful dysfunction concept 
1. 
The condition results from inability of some internal mechanism on the part of the person 
2. 
The condition causes harm to the person 
3. 
Mental illness is defined as harmful dysfunction in terms of a product of disruptions of 
thought, feeling, communication, perception, and motivation. 
4. 
The harmful dysfunction view of mental disorder recognizes that every type of 
dysfunction does not lead to a disorder; only dysfunction that results in significant harm 
to the person are considered to be disorders. 
D. 
DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000) defines mental disorders associated with: (any or all) 
1. 
Present distress 
2. 
Disability (impairment in one or more areas of functioning) 

3. Significant risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom 
E. 
Mental health means more than the absence of mental illness 
1. 
Healthy people can be described as ‘flourishing’ 
2. 
Flourishing people have more positive emotions, are calm and peaceful, have positive 
attitudes, and possess a sense of meaning and purpose 
F. 
Culture and Diagnostic Practice: DSM-IV-TR defines pathologies in terms of our particular 
culture and cultural values 
1. 
Culture is defined in terms of the values, beliefs, and practices that are shared by a 
specific community or group of people 
2. 
Cultural values influence the opinions regarding normal and abnormal behavior 
III. 
Epidemiology 
A. 
The scientific study of the frequency and distribution of disorders within a population 
B. 
Incidence—number of new cases of a disorder that appear in a population during a specific 
period of time 
C. 
Prevalence—total number of active cases that are present in a population during a specific 
period of time (lifetime prevalence—proportion of people in a given population affected by 
the disorder at some point during their lives) 
D. 
Gender differences are found in many but not all mental disorders; most prominent 
differences include: anxiety disorders and depression (more common in women), and 
substance abuse and antisocial personality disorder (more common in men) 
E. 
Comorbidity—the presence of more than one condition at one time in an individual 
F. 
Global Burden of Disease and Injury (Sponsored by World Health Organization 
WHO)—assessed impact of conditions; mental disorders are responsible for 1% of death but 
47% of disability in the U.S. and developed nations 
G. 
Cross-Cultural Comparisons: 90% percent of individuals with Bulimia nervosa are women, 
usually university students, in the Western society 
H. 
Draguns and Tanaka-Matsumi (2003) reported that mental disorders are shaped by culture, no 
mental disorder is caused entirely due to cultural factors, psychotic disorders are less 
influenced by culture, and that the symptoms of disorders vary across cultures 
IV. 
Mental health professions 
A. 
Psychiatrists are physicians (medical doctors) who specialize in treating mental disorders 
(often prescribe medication) 

B. 
Clinical psychologists complete a Ph.D. or a Psy.D. (about 4 years plus internship) and are 
trained in assessment, psychotherapy, and applying scientific principles to the study of 
abnormal psychology 
C. 
Social workers generally hold an M.S.W. and are committed to action that may be socially 
based or individually based 
D. 
Masters-level professional counselors, marriage and family therapists, and psychiatric nurses 
also provide individual and family psychotherapy; non-graduate trained staff often provide 
psychosocial rehabilitation 
E. 
Currently, dramatic changes in the provision of mental health care services are being driven by 
managed care companies, which place emphasis on cost containment 
F. 
Individuals receive treatment in many different types of settings and from a variety of 
professionals, with only 40% of those whom receive treatment have this provided by a 
specialized mental health professional such as the above listed 
G. 
However, 34% of individuals receive treatment for psychiatric problems from their primary 
care physician that does not have specialized training 
V. Historical perspective on psychopathology 
A. 
The Greek tradition: Hippocrates 
1. 
Assumed mental disorders had natural causes, not demonological sources 
2. 
Believed health depended on maintaining a balance of four bodily fluids: blood, phlegm, 
black bile, and yellow bile 
B. 
The Asylum: Middle Ages 
1. 
Established to house the mentally disturbed 
2. 
Moral treatment emphasized support and respect for human dignity 
3. 
Dorothea Dix was a prominent and effective advocate for humane treatment of the 
mentally ill in hospitals 
4. 
Profession of psychiatry emerged from the development of large institutions 
5. 
Woodward’s Worcester Hospital (mid-1800s in U.S.) as a “model institution” employing 
moral and physical treatment approaches—based on protestant values; reported recovery 
rates from 82 to 91 percent between 1833 and 1845 
6. 
Created to serve heavily populated cities and to assume responsibilities that had 
previously been performed by individual families 
C. Lessons from the history of psychopathology 
1. Cultural bias often, perhaps always, influences current thinking and treatment approaches 
2. Scientific research is crucial to identify and understand effective treatment 
VI. The scientific study of mental disorders 
A. 
Basis is the “open-minded skepticism” of the scientific method 
1. Formulation of hypotheses 
2. Collection and analysis of empirical data 
3. Refinement of hypotheses based on findings 
B. 
Case studies can provide a wealth of information about a particular pathology and can help 
generate research questions and hypotheses, but are limited because they can be interpreted in 
many ways and may not be reliable or generalizable 
1. 
Important sources of information 
2. 
Case studies can be viewed from many different perspectives 
3. 
Risky to draw conclusions 
C. 
Clinical Research Methods 
1. 
It is pivotal to understand how it is important to conduct research related to each disorder
